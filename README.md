# Build and Test
1. Select x64 for your Debug Target anf then click Debug(the green play button). If your code works, it should work on your raspberry pi too.
2. To run it on your Raspbery Pi, you need to have your rpi flashed with Windows Iot Core -> https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/iot/downloads
3. After flashing it, when Windows Iot Core is fully loaded, go back to Visual Studios on your computer and select ARM, select Remote Machine, and click the green play button again(it should ask for the device's ip address)
4. Wait, remote device usually takes a longer time :)
